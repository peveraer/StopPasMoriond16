\section{The CMS detector}

The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6\unit{m} internal diameter, 
providing a magnetic field of 3.8\unit{T}. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a 
lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of 
a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity~\cite{JINST} coverage provided by the
 barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside 
the solenoid. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the 
calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4\mus. The high-level
 trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100\unit{kHz} to less than 1\unit{kHz}, before data storage. 
A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant 
kinematic variables, can be found in \reference~\cite{JINST}.
